# Wind Turbine Power Prediction

This project provides a Streamlit-based dashboard for predicting wind turbine active power using a Random Forest model. It includes live sensor simulation, a virtual IoT gateway, and real-time machine learning predictions.

## Features
- Upload and preview CSV datasets  
- Simulate live wind turbine sensor data  
- Send simulated data to a virtual IoT gateway  
- Predict active power using a trained Random Forest model  
- View model metadata and feature importance  

## Usage
1. Simulate sensor values or upload a CSV file  
2. Send data to the virtual gateway  
3. Generate model predictions  
4. Explore model insights and feature importance  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Streamlit
